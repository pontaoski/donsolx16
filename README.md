# Donsol X16

Donsol (short for dungeon solitaire) is a solitary dungeon crawler played with a deck of 54 cards.
Each room has you drawing four cards; hearts are health potions, diamonds are shields, clubs and spades are monsters.
Your aim is to use potions, shields, and combat wisely to get through the entire dungeon of 54 cards.
